### *Description*
*Pitch Perfect* allows a user to record sound, then play the recording back with various effects.

### *Interesting Twists*
- Uses AVAudioEngine to "chain" sound features to create complex effects such as reverb and echo.
- Contains code to remove created ".wav" files when the app closes, so large files aren't cluttering up space. 

### *Setup Requirements*
Just clone and go!
